# AceBook Engineering Project (Front-end)

**Acebook** is [now deployed to Heroku](http://acebook-frontend.herokuapp.com/).

This repo serves as the Express/React front-end to the Acebook Engineering Project hosted on Rails. Please see [this repo](https://github.com/archmagos/acebook-nice-team) for full project details and our final project outcomes.

## Implementation

This repo must be run alongside the back-end Rails repo. In order to host the front-end, clone this repo, then:

```bash
npm install
npm start # app should launch automatically at localhost:4000
```
